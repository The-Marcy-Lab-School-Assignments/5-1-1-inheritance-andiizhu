# Question

What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

Polymorphism is a concept in OOP where the subclass can implement and override the an existing method on the superclass. This allows the subclass to have control over the existing superclass method.

```
class Animal {
    constructor(breed, name) {
        this.breed = breed;
        this.name = name;
    }

    introduction() {
        return `${this.name} is a ${this.breed}.`;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(breed, name, sound) {
        super(breed, name);
        this.sound = sound;
    }
    makeSound() {
        return `${this.name} says ${this.sound}.`;
    }
    introduction() {
        return `${this.sound}, ${this.name} is a ${this.breed}.`;
    }
}

```
