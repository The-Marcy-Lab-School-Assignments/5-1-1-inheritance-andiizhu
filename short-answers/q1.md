# Question

What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer

The differenced between an `instance` method and a `class` method is due to the scope of the method. An `instance` method is able to be used to refer to data that is inside of each `instance`. `Instance` methods can be used to change `instance` properties and call `instance` properties and methods. a A `class` method is used to refer to the data pertaining to the whole `class`. If updates are made to the `class` state using `class` methods, it will impact future `instances`.
